# AI Chat Bot(yapper_bot)

 built an AI-powered mobile app using Flutter and Google Gemini. While this project isnâ€™t meant for public release, itâ€™s been a fantastic way to deepen my understanding of how AI can be seamlessly integrated into mobile experiences. ðŸš€

#What I Worked On:
-Leveraging Flutter for intuitive and responsive UI.
-Exploring Google Gemini to bring advanced AI functionalities into a mobile app.

This project was all about learning and pushing my boundaries. Sharing this video as a milestone in my journeyâ€”and who knows, maybe it will inspire others to dive into their own AI projects!
